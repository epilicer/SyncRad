Geant4 simulations for synchrotron radiation

In this Geant4 simulation, synchrotron radiation from  electrons under a uniform magnetic field have been investigated through constructed detector by using GDML. I performed this study for the electrons which will be bend before entering to the interaction region of LHeC detector.

The folder also includes Root macros to check overlappings in GDML and to plot results.

After compiling, run the example with -----> ./SyncRad test.gdml my.mac
